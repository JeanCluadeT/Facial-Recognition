A simple program that recognizes a face  after being trained on a sample of faces

                                   INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTING THE FILE
                                   
--> Run the following commands on your pycharm terminal before executing the FaceRecognizer.py file. 

1)  pip install opencv-contrib-python
2)  pip install numpy

--> After installing the above dependencies create a new project in pycharm and copy the code from FaceRecognizer.py into new python file.

--> Paste the three folders namely training-data,test-data and opencv-files into the location of the python file(inside pycharm projects) you created in the above step.

--> Now run the FaceRecognizer.py file from your pycharm ide.

Note: I took Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan as examples but you can change that by changing the training data and test data folder images and also change the labels given in the code.
      Just make sure that the image names and folder names are same when you replace images because the program is configured according to that image and folder name only.
